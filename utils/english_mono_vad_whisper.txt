[30.0s] SPEAKER_01: Israel launched an attack on Iran last Friday, targeting nuclear and military facilities.
[35.4s] SPEAKER_00: The strikes killed several senior Iranian military commanders and Iranian nuclear scientists.

[44.6s] SPEAKER_00: Iran's health ministry said at least 224 people have been killed in the Israeli strikes.
[50.3s] SPEAKER_01: While Israel says Iranian attacks have killed 24 people.
[54.1s] SPEAKER_00: Let's have our first headline.
[55.7s] SPEAKER_00: Iran launches new missile barrage.
[57.9s] SPEAKER_00: Israel claims assassination of top general, and that's from the Palestine Chronicle.
[62.0s] SPEAKER_01: And that headline again from the Palestine Chronicle.
[64.5s] SPEAKER_01: Iran launches new missile barrage.
[66.8s] SPEAKER_01: Israel claims assassination of top general.
[69.5s] SPEAKER_00: This headline is about missile strikes by Iran against Israel in response to Israel strikes against Iran, which began on Friday, and Israel's killing of a senior military official.
[81.1s] SPEAKER_00: We're looking at this word, barrage.
[83.6s] SPEAKER_00: Iran launches new missile barrage.
[86.8s] SPEAKER_00: What is a barrage?
[88.2s] SPEAKER_01: Well, the specific use in the context of war is a heavy and continuous use of things like guns or bombs.
[95.4s] SPEAKER_01: So a missile barrage means a country is sending lots of missiles at once.
[100.0s] SPEAKER_00: Now, this is obviously a serious use, but we can also use a barrage of something in more everyday contexts to mean a large amount of something that comes all at once.
[111.4s] SPEAKER_00: For example, the new employee sent her boss a barrage of questions via email.
[116.7s] SPEAKER_01: Yes, or I turned my phone off last night and woke up to a barrage of text messages.
[122.0s] SPEAKER_00: Whether it's being used literally or metaphorically, barrage has this sense that it's an overwhelming amount of something.
[130.3s] SPEAKER_00: It's too much all at once.
[132.7s] SPEAKER_00: So it often seems quite negative.
[134.8s] SPEAKER_01: We've had a barrage, a large amount of something that comes all at once.
[139.0s] SPEAKER_00: For example, the TV show received a barrage of complaints after the presenter made an offensive comment.
[145.0s] SPEAKER_01: This is learning English from the news from BBC Learning English.
[148.7s] SPEAKER_01: We're talking about the Israel Iran strikes.

[157.4s] SPEAKER_01: Satellite images have shown us that the strikes have damaged structures at two missile sites as well as an airport runway.
[164.0s] SPEAKER_00: Let's have another headline, and this is from CNN.
[166.6s] SPEAKER_00: Israel strikes zeroed in on Iran's nuclear program.
[170.5s] SPEAKER_00: How much damage was done?
[171.8s] SPEAKER_01: And that headline again, Israel strikes zeroed in on Iran's nuclear program.
[176.6s] SPEAKER_01: How much damage was done?
[178.1s] SPEAKER_01: And that is from CNN.
[179.4s] SPEAKER_00: So this headline is about those Israeli strikes against Iran's nuclear program.
[184.5s] SPEAKER_00: This time we're looking at this phrase zero in on what can you tell us?
[189.4s] SPEAKER_01: So this is another phrase which has a specific military meaning and more everyday meaning as well.
[195.1s] SPEAKER_01: So in this context it's about aiming a weapon at a particular target.
[199.5s] SPEAKER_01: Israel's strikes are aiming at Iran's nuclear program.
[202.7s] SPEAKER_01: They've zeroed in on it according to the headline.
[205.1s] SPEAKER_00: In a more everyday sense, zero in on means to focus all your attention on something.
[210.5s] SPEAKER_00: For example, imagine you're in a work meeting, everyone is sharing lots of ideas, but you need to focus on one solution and work on it.
[218.6s] SPEAKER_01: Yes, you might say, okay, let's zero in on Beth's idea and come up with a plan.
[223.3s] SPEAKER_00: We've had zero in on focus, all your attention on something.
[227.3s] SPEAKER_01: For example, the government has said they will zero in on youth unemployment this year.
[231.7s] SPEAKER_01: It's their main focus.
[233.0s] SPEAKER_00: This is learning English from the news, our podcast about the news headlines.
[237.5s] SPEAKER_00: Today, our story is Israeli Iran strikes.
[241.1s] SPEAKER_01: Shortly after the start of the Israel Iran strikes, there was a G7 summit in Canada, a meeting between seven major industrialized countries.
[249.4s] SPEAKER_00: U.S.
[249.8s] SPEAKER_00: President Donald Trump left early.
[252.2s] SPEAKER_00: Francis President Emmanuel Macron said Trump did this to work on a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran, but Trump denied there was any connection.
[260.6s] SPEAKER_01: And we have a headline about this, it's from France 24.
[264.4s] SPEAKER_01: Trump says early G7 exit nothing to do with Macron's remarks on Israel Iran's ceasefire offer.
[270.9s] SPEAKER_00: That headline again, Trump says early G7 exit, nothing to do with Macron's remarks on Israel Iran's ceasefire offer, and that's from France 24.
[279.8s] SPEAKER_01: So this headline says Trump's exit has nothing to do with a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and we're looking at this phrase to do with, to do with, to do with, three words that everyone knows, but together, the phrase is a bit strange, isn't it?
[294.4s] SPEAKER_00: Yes, to do with means about or connected to.
[299.5s] SPEAKER_00: And here it says nothing to do with, which means it's not connected to.
[304.4s] SPEAKER_00: So Trump said that his early exit is not connected with a ceasefire.
[309.4s] SPEAKER_00: It's nothing to do with a ceasefire.
[311.3s] SPEAKER_01: Okay, another example, this podcast is about the news.
[314.9s] SPEAKER_01: It has nothing to do with cooking.
[316.7s] SPEAKER_01: It's all to do with the news headlines and vocabulary.
[319.5s] SPEAKER_00: That's right.
[320.1s] SPEAKER_00: So we can add words to do with nothing to do with.
[324.8s] SPEAKER_00: All to do with something to do with everything to do with.
[329.0s] SPEAKER_01: And you can hear to do with in combination with has, has got and is.
[334.0s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is a really useful phrase, isn't it?
[336.2s] SPEAKER_00: We use it a lot in everyday speech.
[339.2s] SPEAKER_00: Now, my laptop hasn't been working very well today.
[342.1s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, neither is mine.
[343.1s] SPEAKER_01: I think it's something to do with the new software.
[345.3s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's got nothing to do with the Wi-Fi because my phone's working fine.
[349.0s] SPEAKER_01: We've had to do with about or connected to
[352.2s] SPEAKER_00: For example, I'm not sleeping very well lately.
